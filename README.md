# HSD Indoor Navigation System

A comprehensive indoor navigation solution for Building 4 at Hochschule DÃ¼sseldorf, designed with accessibility as a core principle. The system provides barrier-free navigation through WLAN positioning, audio feedback, and intuitive interfaces.

## System Architecture

This project consists of four main components:

### 1. Navigation Client (React Native)
Mobile application providing:
- WLAN-based indoor positioning
- Barrier-free navigation interface
- Audio descriptions for rooms and waypoints
- Support for visual and tactile navigation modes

### 2. Navigation Server (Hono.js REST API)
Backend services handling:
- Position determination using WLAN fingerprinting
- Route calculation and navigation guidance 
- Grid square mapping
- Integration with Context Server

### 3. Room Information Website (SvelteKit)
Web application providing:
- Room information and occupancy details
- Accessible interface for users
- Audio descriptions for each room
- Mobile-optimized views integrated into the navigation client

### 4. Admin Interface (HTML/JavaScript)
Tool for system configuration:
- Position simulation and testing
- Grid square visualization
- Route testing and validation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Blankjr/hsd-indoor-navigation.git
```
2. Follow setup instructions in each component's README:
    - Navigation Server Setup
    - Navigation Client Setup
    - Room Info Website Setup
    - Admin Interface Setup
## Development
Each component can be developed independently, but for full system testing:

1. Start the navigation server
2. Launch the room info website
3. Run the navigation client
4. Use admin interface for testing if wlan fingerprinting mode deactivated

## Technology Stack

- Client: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Paper
- Server: Hono.js, Node.js, TypeScript
- Website: SvelteKit, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Admin UI: HTML, JavaScript, CSS

## Project Background
This system was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis focusing on barrier-free indoor navigation. It combines WLAN positioning with accessible interfaces to provide navigation assistance for users with different needs.
